# Recursion-theoretical approach to Implicit Computational Complexity

For a year this has been my most promising approach towards a programming language for FLOGSPACE.
This is based on Bellantoni and Cook characterization
of PTIME ([https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~sacook/homepage/ptime.pdf](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~sacook/homepage/ptime.pdf)) and on further work by Neergaard to characterize FLOGSPACE in a similar way.
But programming in this way is just plain torturous.

Nevertheless, I have obtained the non-published source code from the author, polished and released it with
a correct, free license: [https://github.com/ruplet/neergaard-logspace-characterization](https://github.com/ruplet/neergaard-logspace-characterization)
