# Reverse mathematics and bounded arithmetics
If we can limit mathematics to not use axiom of choice (and study what we can and cannot prove after the restriction), why
not limit computer science to not use full recursion? 

In 1985 Sam Buss PhD thesis was released [@buss1985bounded] introducing Bounded arithmetic.

Very good book released in 2010b by Stephen Cook: [https://www.karlin.mff.cuni.cz/~krajicek/cook-nguyen.pdf](https://www.karlin.mff.cuni.cz/~krajicek/cook-nguyen.pdf). 

Good text from July 2025: [https://eccc.weizmann.ac.il/report/2025/086/](https://eccc.weizmann.ac.il/report/2025/086/).

My work on formalizing bounded arithmetic is here: [https://github.com/ruplet/formalization-of-bounded-arithmetic](https://github.com/ruplet/formalization-of-bounded-arithmetic) - in this repo there is also my presentation from AITP, the abstract and the reviews it received.

This is also the subject of my visit at INRIA, beginning 8th September 2025.
