## Proving unprovability: Kripke semantics
- even though searching for a countermodel in Kripke semantics is completely infeasible computationally, we have a good tool for the job!
- i tested and it works, find countermodels and proofs of intuitionistic formulas. code: https://github.com/ferram/jtabwb_provers/tree/master

> This chapter explicitly avoids control effects and dependent types to focus on type preservation. However, in general, we may want to combine the two. Herbelin (2005) shows that unrestricted use of call/cc and throw in a language with $\Sigma$ types and equality leads to an inconsistent system.  The inconsistency is caused by type dependency on terms involving control effects.  Herbelin (2012) solves the inconsistency by constraining types to depend only on negative-elimination-free (NEF) terms, which are free of effects. This restriction makes dependent types compatible with classical reasoning enabled by the control operators.

- How to find specific programs for:
  * DC (dependent choice) = quote
  * Peirce law = call/cc
  * ZF axioms = ?
  * AC = ?
  * CH = forcing
- Do side-effects correspond to specific axioms? (pierre marie pedrot curry howard isomorphism for dummies)
  * looping (call/cc)
  * exceptions (Markov's rule, Friedman's trick)
  * global state (~CH; forcing)
  * delimited continuations (double negation shift)
- Extending the Curry-Howard correspondence:
  * axiom: system primitive
  * soundness theorem: compiler
  * completeness theorem: debugger
  * incompleteness theorem: infinite loops
  * axiom of choice trivial in intuitionistic logic, monster in classical
