abstract="We introduce a typed functional programming language for logarithmic space. Its type system is an annotated subsystem of Hofmann's polytime LFPL. To guide the design of the programming language and to enable the proof of logspace-soundness, we introduce a realisability model over a variant of the Geometry of Interaction. This realisability model, which takes inspiration from M{\o}ller-Neergaard and Mairson's work on BC{\$}^{\{}{\backslash}rm --{\}}{\_}{\{}{\backslash}epsilon{\}}{\$}, provides a general framework for modelling space-restricted computation.",

abstract="More than being just a tool for expressing algorithms, a well-designed programming language allows the user to express her ideas efficiently. The design choices however effect the efficiency of the algorithms written in the languages. It is therefore important to understand how such choices effect the expressibility of programming languages.",

abstract="A well known result of proof theory is the characterization of primitive recursive functions {\textflorin} as those provably recursive in the first order theory of Peano arithmetic with the induction axiom restricted to $\Sigma$1 formulas. In this paper, we study a variety of weak theories of first order arithmetic, whose provably total functions (with graphs of a certain form) are exactly those computable within some resource bound on a particular computation model (boolean circuits, with possible parity or MOD 6 gates, or threshold circuits, or alternating Turing machines, or ordinary Turing machines). To establish these kinds of results for small complexity classes, we provide a recursion-theoretic characterization of the complexity class, prove how one can encode sequences in very weak theories, and use the witnessing technique of [7].",
