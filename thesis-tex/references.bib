    abstract = { We present a series of operators of apparently increasing power which when added to first-order logic produce a series of languages in which exactly the properties checkable in a certain complexity class may be expressed. We thus give alternate characterizations of most important complexity classes. We also introduce reductions appropriate for our setting: first-order translations, and a restricted, quantifier free version of these called projection translations. We show that projection translations are a uniform version of Valiant’s projections, and that the usual complete problems remain complete via these very restrictive reductions. }

We give a characterization of the complexity class Uniform NC as an algebra of functions on the natural numbers which is the closure of several basic functions under composition and a schema of recursion. We then define a fragment of bounded arithmetic, and, using our characterization of Uniform NC, show that this fragment is capable of proving the totality of all of the functions in Uniform NC. Lastly, in the spirit of Buss, we show that any function which is definable by a ∑b1-formula in our theory is a function which is in Uniform NC.}

In both characterizations, NC1 functions are regarded as functions from one class of finite relational structures to another. In the algebraic characterization a recursion scheme called upward tree recursion is applied to a class of simple functions. In the logical characterization, first-order logic is augmented by an operator for defining relations by primitive recursion where it is assumed that every structure has an underlying relation BIT giving the binary representations of integers.}

In other words, we give a recursion-theoretic characterization of the complexity classes NC k for k 1 without reference to a machine model, nor explicit bounds in the recursion schema. Actually, we give two equivalent descriptions of the classes NC k , k 1 . One is based on a tree structure \`{a} la Leivant, the other is based on words. This latter puts into light the role of computation of pointers in circuit complexity. We show that transducers are a key concept for pointer evaluation.},
