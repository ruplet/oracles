# Appendix C: Type theory induced by category with sufficient structure

Computational complexity is a semantic property of a program. Since we
want to reason about semantics, it is of great interest for us for our
semantics to have nice properties. A connection exists, which can be
described as follows
[\[1\]](#ref-nlab:relation_between_type_theory_and_category_theory):

> Type theory and certain kinds of category theory are closely related.
> By a syntax-semantics duality[^1] one may view type theory as a formal

Under this correspondence, we identify the notion of proposition in
logic with the notions of type in type theory and object in category
theory. Similarly, logical false corresponds to empty type / initial
object, truth to unit type / terminal object, conjuction to product type
/ product, disjunction to sum type / coproduct etc
[\[2\]](#ref-nlab:computational_trilogy)

For a brief overview of results in this area, we present a table of
logical systems and their corresponding categories of contexts[^2].

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
  Internal Logic[^3] / Type Theory   Category of Contexts (Semantics)
  (Syntax)

  Propositional logic                Lindenbaum--Tarski algebra (\~Kripke
                                     model)

  Intuitionistic propositional logic Heyting algebra

  Minimal logic / Simply typed       Cartesian closed category (CCC)
  lambda calculus (STLC)

If we could design a category such that constructible morphisms
correspond to feasible computations, then by taking the internal
language of such a category, we would obtain a programming language
capturing (some) complexity class.

However, complexity theory is, for now, very distant from category
theory. During the exploration of this approach, I stumbled upon
discussion on stackexchange.com, regarding the problem: "Does it make
sense to consider a category of all NP-complete problems, with morphisms
as poly-time reductions between different instances?"[\[3\]](#ref-3074).
The discussion suggested that it doesn't make a sense to go this
direction. One of the answers[\[4\]](#ref-3422) introduced me to
*Implicit Computational Complexity*, which turned out to be the field of
research I should solely focus on since the beginning of my work.

Category theory is important for people developing e.g.Â type theory of
Lean. But it is, for now, too far away from providing anything for
studying computational complexity. We don't explore this connection
further.
