(* Exercise 5.1.a: not x < 0 *)
lemma exercise_5_1_a: "~ (x < 0)"
proof
  assume "x < 0"
  then have "x <= 0" and "x ~= 0" by simp_all
  from B9 have "0 <= x" .
  then have "((x <= 0) \<and> (0 <= x)) --> (x = 0)" using B7 by blast
  then have "x = 0" using `x <= 0` `0 <= x` by blast
  with `x ~= 0` show False by contradiction
