\chapter{Formalized semantics}\label{chap:formalized-semantics}
\todo[inline]{In this short chapter, I describe why a language: C++ + mathematical proofs of
being in complexity, is infeasible. This is because reasonign about Turing machines
in Coq is a nightmare and I cite resources for it. On the other hand, C++ + just a polynomial
cutting off the computation after step n is a bad idea, as we can't reason abot the 
semantics at all}
