\section{Decisional and functional problems}
When we hear a sentence like ``prime factorization is in NP'', it usually
means that the \emph{decisional} version of this problem is decidable in NP.

But we actually usually want to reason about complexity of \emph{functions},
and it appears to not be equivalent. E.g. \ the graph of exponential function is 
decidable in polytime, but calculating exponential function is not.

There is surprisingly little literature on functional complexity classes.
An interesting case is TFNP, studied later in~\ref{sec:complexity-class-tfnp}.
Another interesting case are \emph{transductors}.

\section{Uniformity}
Dlogtime-uniformity. First-order reductions. Logspace-uniformity. $U_{E^*}$. Direct / extended connection language.
Below it should not matter which of these types we use? But I don't have citation for that.
When we don't say poly, it means class is uniform. Otherwise: Immerman showed that the class FO is the same as a uniform version
of AC 0 . Originally AC0 was defined in its nonuniform version, which
we shall refer to as AC0/poly. A language in AC0/poly is specified by
a polynomial size bounded depth family $\langle C_n \rangle$ of Boolean circuits, where
each circuit Cn has n input bits, and is allowed to have Â¬-gates, as well as
unbounded fan-in $\land$-gates and $\lor$-gates. In the uniform version, the circuit
C n must be specified in a uniform way; for example one could require that
$\langle C_n \rangle$ is in FO\@. See also Appendix A.5.

We say that family of circuits in AC0 is uniform if the function $n \rightarrow C_n$ is
 *simple to compute*; there is a variety of notions of uniformity of AC0 circuits, which
  we will explore in (TODO: chapter reductions). For the sake of this section we can assume
   that by AC0 we will denote the class of circuit families $C_n$, for which there is a 
   LOGSPACE Turing machine $M$ which on input $0^n$ outputs a *standard representation*


\section{\texorpdfstring{$\text{NC}^i$}{NC\string^i}}
$\text{AC}^i$ is the class of languages accepted by uniform circuit
families of polynomial size and depth $O(\log^i n)$, consisting of unbounded fan-in
AND, and OR gates, along with NOT gates.

Contained in $\text{AC}^i$.

\subsection{NC0}
For example, each output of an NC0 computable function can depend on only finitely many
inputs. Thus, NC0 can't even compute an AND of all its inputs (in contrast, the unbounded
fan-in AND is an AC0 function).
# NC0
- One-way permutations in NC0: [@10.1016/0020-01908790053-6]
- All sets complete under AC0 reductions are in fact already complete under NC0 reductions: [@10.1145/258533.258671] [@AGRAWAL1998127]
- Immerman at page 81 shows how to do addition in NC0 and MAJORITY in NC1 [@Immerman1998-IMMDC]
- Addition and substraction of binary numbers is in AC0: [@27676]
- This is not trivial, as these algorithms in NC0/AC0 use Chinese Remainder Representation or Fermat's Little Theorem!



It is not clear what should be the notion of uniformity for $\text{NC}^0$,
as Dlogtime Turing machines can do things that cannot be done by
any $\text{NC}^0$ circuit.
\subsection{NC1}
- Division is in DLOGTIME-uniform NC1: [@ITA_2001__35_3_259_0]
- Reductions for NC1: Dlogtime!
- Reductions for NC1: UE* reductions; UE*-uniform NC1 = ALOGTIME [@RUZZO1981365]


\section{\texorpdfstring{$\text{AC}^i$}{AC\string^i}}
$\text{AC}^i$ is the class of languages accepted by uniform circuit
families of polynomial size and depth $O(\log^i n)$, consisting of unbounded fan-in
AND, and OR gates, along with NOT gates.

Given $x, y, z$: binary representations of natural numbers,
it is decidable in uniform AC0 if $x + y = z$, but it is not decidable 
in AC0 if $x * y = z$.

A family of circuits $\langle C_n \rangle_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$ for $n$:
number of input bits is in AC0 iff every $C_n$ is of depth $O(1)$ and polynomial 
size w.r.t $n$, contains only unlimited-fanin AND gates and OR gates, and optional 
NOT gates at the inputs. 

\subsection{AC0}
- Addition is in AC0 [@BussLectureNotes]
- FO[+, *] = DLOGTIME-uniform AC0 (https://complexityzoo.net/Complexity_Zoo:A#ac0)
- Discussion of DLOGTIME-uniform AC0: [@hella2023regularrepresentationsuniformtc0]
- Tutaj mamy definicje AC0, TC0, FATC0, FTC0 etc.: [@AGRAWAL2000395]
notions of uniformity of ac0:
0. U_{E^*}-uniformity
1. direct connection language / extended connection language is decidable by FO.
2. is decidable by DLogTime on a random-access turing machine (check if ith bit of representation of nth circuit is b)



\section{\texorpdfstring{$\text{AC}^i[m]$}{AC\string^i[m]}}
$\text{AC}^i[m]$ is defined as $\text{AC}^i$, but in addition unbounded fan-in $\text{MOD}_m$ gates
are allowed, which output 1 iff the number of input wires carrying a value of 1 is a
multiple of $m$.

\section{\texorpdfstring{$\text{ACC}^i$}{ACC\string^i}}
$\text{ACC}^i = \bigcup_m \text{AC}^i[m]$. $\text{ACC}^0$ is contained in $\text{TC}^0$.

\section{\texorpdfstring{$\text{TC}^i$}{TC\string^i}}
$\text{TC}^i$ is the class of languages accepted by uniform circuit families 
of polynomial size and depth $O(\log^i n)$, consisting of unbounded fan-in MAJORITY
gates, along with NOT gates.

Contained in $\text{NC}^{i + 1}$.
\subsection{TC0}
- Multiplication is in TC0 [@BussLectureNotes], this resource cites this: [@doi:10.1137/0213028] but i cant find relevant info there


\section{P}
Poly-time relations. To define reductions between P-complete problems,
first-order/$\text{AC}^0$ reductions are typically used.

\subsection{inv-P}
Permutation-invariant P; P on unordered structures.

\section{FP}
Poly-time functions.

\section{NP}
reductions used here are precisely the class FL of logspace reductions!

\section{TFNP}
\label{sec:complexity-class-tfnp}

\section{\texorpdfstring{$\text{AC}^0$-reduction}{AC\string^0-reduction}}
\label{sec:ac0red}
Definition IX.1.1 CN10. We say that a string function F
(resp. a number function f) is $\text{AC}^0$ -reducible to L if there is a sequence
of string functions $F_1, \dots, F_n (n \geqslant 0)$ such that
$F_i$ is $\Sigma^B_0$-definable from $L \cup \{F_1, \dots , F_{i-1}\}$, for $i = 1, \dots, n$
and F (resp. f) is $\Sigma^B_0$ -definable from $L \cup \{F_1, \dots , F_{i-1}\}$. A relation R is
$\text{AC}^0$-reducible to L if there is a sequence $F_1, \dots, F_n$ as above, and R is
represented by a $\Sigma^B_0(L \cup \{F_1, \dots, F_n\})$ formula.

In (chapter 2, \cite{edbd4873718c414f90d22dadf0dba2b1}) there is an extensive discussion about
the different subtleties of defining $\text{AC}^0$ functions and numerous different characterizations
of Dlogtime-uniform $\text{AC}^0$-computable functions.


\section{\texorpdfstring{$\text{NC}^0$}{NC\string^0} reductions}
In~\cite{edbd4873718c414f90d22dadf0dba2b1}, it is shown that, surprisingly, all known NP-complete problems
are complete under $\text{NC}^0/poly$ reductions already. Another candidate for a problem that is NP-complete
under poly-time reductions but not under logspace reductions is discussed in~\cite{18631}.

\section{DLOGTIME-uniformity}
- example of DLOGTIME reduction to show tree isomorphism for string-represented trees, is NC1-complete [@694595]


\section{First-order reduction}

rozdzial 12.3

# FO
- FO[+, *] = FO[BIT]
- FO[<, *] = FO[BIT] (Crane Beach Conjecture)
- FO[+] is less expressive than FO[<, *] = FO[<, /] = FO[<, COPRIME] [@10.1002/malq.200310041]
3. fo-query: definition 1.26, immerman
fo-uniformity: there is a first order query I : STRUC[ts] -> STRUC[tc] with I(0^n) = C_n; definition 5.16 immerman
fo-reduction is defined as a first-order query (definition 1.26)
also there is definition how to represent a circuit!

\section{First-order projection}

\section{LOGSPACE reduction}
- Reductions for L: e.g. first-order reductions, Immerman 1999 p.51
- USTCONN is complete for L
- a programming language for L: a finite number of variables, each <= n
- alternative: a finite number of input pointers; this is really similar to multi-head two-way automaton [@423885] [@10.1007/BF00289513]

\section{P reduction}

\section{Complete problems}
\label{sec:complete-problems}
For every class C from: AC0, L, P, there is some problem F such that F is C-complete under AC0 reductions.
So AC0 reductions are enough for us, and AC0 reductions is(?) the same class as FAC0 functions.

\subsection{Functional complexity classes and completeness}
To show FL-completeness, it suffices to show L-completeness: FL = L* = L + NC1 
reductions [@COOK19852, proposition 4.1]

\section{Which class we will focus on?}
\label{sec:classes-of-interest}
For chapters about ICC we will focus on L and P, as these are the most abundant reductions,
and other classes might have problems like in the below subsections.
Later, in the chapter about bounded arithmetic we will find that we actually want to care
about characterization of $\text{AC}^0$-reductions.

- Why P and L are important and robust complexity classes
> The smallest class containing linear time and closed under subroutines is P. The smallest class containing log space and closed under subroutines is still log space. So P and L are the smallest robust classes for time and space respectively which is why they feel right for modeling efficient computation.

\subsection{Fine-grained complexity theory}
We will not realistically capture $\text{TIME}(O(n))$ or anything of this kind,
as the field of fine-grained complexity is relatively modern and little or none interesting
characterizations of these classes have been found as of writing this work.

\subsection{Semantic and syntactic complexity classes}
Which classes can we realistially try to characterize? Probably not BPP, nor permutation-invariant PTIME.

- About semantic and syntactic complexity classes
> An interesting difference is that PR functions can be explicitly enumerated, whereas functions in R cannot be (since otherwise the halting problem would be decidable). In this sense, PR is a "syntactic" class whereas R is "semantic."
