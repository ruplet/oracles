\todo[inline]{Here, just show that Ugo dal Lago created IntML.
Say roughly what linear types are, don't get into details.}

% One instance is the language \emph{IntML} by Dal Lago and Sch\"opp, 
% designed to capture \textbf{\complexity{FLOGSPACE}} via a linear typing discipline \cite{DALLAGO2016150}.
% An implementation is available.\footnote{\url{https://github.com/uelis/IntML}.}

% What if we could encode in the type system that a function can only read an argument once?
% Or that if you call a function A -> B on argument of type A, then you have access to an element
% of type B, but lose the access to the original argument A (goes out of scope)?
% Consider such a semantics of computer program:
% - (contraction) once you use a variable, it goes out of scope
% - (weakening) function is incorrect if at the end of it, some variable is still in scope (was unused)
% This allows us to reason about resource usage in programs.
% This idea is studied by the field of linear type systems.

% A popular way to think of typed programs is to
% think of an object of type $a -> b$ as a method to 
% transform objects of type a to objects of type b.
% so, if you obtain something of type $a$ (so, the type a is nonempty),
% and something of type $a -> b$, then you can also obtain something of type $b$.

% \section{Linear logic}
% % perhaps take intro from this: https://theses.hal.science/tel-01123737v1/file/2015ENSL0981.pdf

% Linear type systems are fully inspired by substructural logics.
% They consider changing contraction and weakening rule, but keep exchange rule.

% The formal bridge between the theories of linear types and the different kinds of linear logics is the Curry--Howard correspondence
% (also known as propositions as types, or proofs as programs).
% Extensive literature exists in this area, also known as the Curry--Howard correspondence. A good introduction to it is a book by S\o{}rensen and Urzyczyn: [@10.5555/1197021].
% The resource interpretation is also there.

% In 2013, Dal Lago and Sch\"opp introduced \textbf{IntML}, a functional programming language with a linear type system that characterizes \complexity{FLOGSPACE} \cite{DALLAGO2016150}. This marked a significant milestone for Implicit Computational Complexity (ICC). An implementation of IntML is available on GitHub\footnote{\url{https://github.com/uelis/IntML}. Following my private communication with the authors, a permissive license was added to the repository, as it was not included originally.}, and to the best of my knowledge it remains the only language within the linear-logic branch of ICC that has both a working implementation and some potential for (academic) practical use.

% Despite this achievement, IntML's complex typing rules make it difficult to translate most standard imperative algorithms into the language without substantial modification. While, in principle, the language could serve as a platform for reimplementing well-known algorithms within this new paradigm, the steep learning curve creates a significant barrier to adoption. As a result, it is unlikely to become a convenient tool for algorithm designers.

% For these reasons, we decided not to pursue IntML further and not to focus on linear type systems in this work. Instead, we turn to another language discussed in Section~\autoref{chap:icc-recursion-theory}.

% Haskell has some. Rust also. Idris 2 has some. F*, Q*. quantum programming uses that a lot!
