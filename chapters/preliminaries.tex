\chapter{Preliminaries}\label{chap:preliminaries}
In this chapter we introduce the standard definitions for logic and complexity theory, necessary to
fix the language we will use in the rest of the work. 
We solely focus on first-order logic and don't introduce the similar
definitions of propositional calculus and second-order logic. The semantics is entirely classical
(in the sense of classical or intuitionistic logic). 

In~\autoref{sec:defs-preliminaries-circuits} we exclusively introduce the so-called \emph{non-uniform}
circuit families, to later consider the different notions of uniformity in~\autoref{chap:circuits}.

\begin{remark}[Bibliography]
The definitions in~\autoref{sec:defs-single-sorted} are in the style of~\cites[Section~2B]{CookNguyenDraft}[Section~II.2]{Cook_Nguyen_2010}.
The definitions in~\autoref{sec:defs-two-sorted} are in the style of~\cites[Section~4B]{CookNguyenDraft}[Section~IV.2]{Cook_Nguyen_2010}.
We will mostly need them for~\autoref{chap:bounded-arithmetic}, but also for~\autoref{chap:descriptive-complexity} --- 
the results discussed in the latter are mostly from~\cite{Immerman1999-IMMDC},
where different style of definitions is used.
However,~\cite{Immerman1999-IMMDC} doesn't introduce two-sorted logic.
The single-sorted definitions differences are mostly negligible and the consistent treatment of
single- and two-sorted logic, is important for~\autoref{chap:bounded-arithmetic}.

Much effort has been put into
considering different versions of the definitions in~\autoref{sec:decisional-complexity-classes}
to keep them consistent
with the definitions of functional complexity classes studied later in~\autoref{sec:functional-complexity-classes},
e.g.\ the class \complexity{FNP} defined in~\autoref{def:complexity-fnp}.
These are much less standard, and often have no clear consensus in the literature.

The definitions of decisional circuit classes are from~\cite{10.5555/520668}.
