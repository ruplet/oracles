Furthermore, these sets remain NP-complete even under nonuniform NC0 reductions. More generally, we show two theorems that hold for any complexity class script C sign closed under (uniform) NC1-computable many-one reductions.

Isomorphism: The sets complete for script C sign under AC0 reductions are all isomorphic under isomorphisms computable and invertible by AC0 circuits of depth three. Our Gap Theorem does not hold for strongly uniform reductions; we show that there are Dlogtime-uniform AC0-complete sets for NC1 that are not Dlogtime-uniform NC0-complete.",

abstract = {We argue that uniform circuit complexity introduced by Borodin is a reasonable model of parallel complexity. Three main results are presented. First, we show that alternating Turing machines are also a surprisingly good model of parallel complexity, by showing that simultaneous size/depth of uniform circuits is the same as space/time of alternating Turing machines, with depth and time within a constant factor and likewise log(size) and space. Second, we apply this to characterize NC, the class of polynomial size and polynomial-in-log depth circuits, in terms of tree-size bounded alternating TMs and other models. In particular, this enables us to show that context-free language recognition is in NC. Third, we investigate various definitions of uniform circuit complexity, showing that it is fairly insensitive to the choice of definition.}

abstract = {The class NC consists of problems solvable very fast (in time polynomial in log n) in parallel with a feasible (polynomial) number of processors. Many natural problems in NC are known; in this paper an attempt is made to identify important subclasses of NC and give interesting examples in each subclass. The notion of NC1-reducibility is introduced and used throughout (problem R is NC1-reducible to problem S if R can be solved with uniform log-depth circuits using oracles for S). Problems complete with respect to this reducibility are given for many of the subclasses of NC. A general technique, the “parallel greedy algorithm,” is identified and used to show that finding a minimum spanning forest of a graph is reducible to the graph accessibility problem and hence is in NC2 (solvable by uniform Boolean circuits of depth O(log2 n) and polynomial size). The class LOGCFL is given a new characterization in terms of circuit families. The class DET of problems reducible to integer determinants is defined and many examples given. A new problem complete for deterministic polynomial time is given, namely, finding the lexicographically first maximal clique in a graph. This paper is a revised version of S. A. Cook, (1983, in “Proceedings 1983 Intl. Found. Comut. Sci. Conf.,” Lecture Notes in Computer Science Vol. 158, pp. 78–93, Springer-Verlag, Berlin/New York).}
