abstract = {We argue that uniform circuit complexity introduced by Borodin is a reasonable model of parallel complexity. Three main results are presented. First, we show that alternating Turing machines are also a surprisingly good model of parallel complexity, by showing that simultaneous size/depth of uniform circuits is the same as space/time of alternating Turing machines, with depth and time within a constant factor and likewise log(size) and space. Second, we apply this to characterize NC, the class of polynomial size and polynomial-in-log depth circuits, in terms of tree-size bounded alternating TMs and other models. In particular, this enables us to show that context-free language recognition is in NC. Third, we investigate various definitions of uniform circuit complexity, showing that it is fairly insensitive to the choice of definition.}

abstract = {The class NC consists of problems solvable very fast (in time polynomial in log n) in parallel with a feasible (polynomial) number of processors. Many natural problems in NC are known; in this paper an attempt is made to identify important subclasses of NC and give interesting examples in each subclass. The notion of NC1-reducibility is introduced and used throughout (problem R is NC1-reducible to problem S if R can be solved with uniform log-depth circuits using oracles for S). Problems complete with respect to this reducibility are given for many of the subclasses of NC. A general technique, the “parallel greedy algorithm,” is identified and used to show that finding a minimum spanning forest of a graph is reducible to the graph accessibility problem and hence is in NC2 (solvable by uniform Boolean circuits of depth O(log2 n) and polynomial size). The class LOGCFL is given a new characterization in terms of circuit families. The class DET of problems reducible to integer determinants is defined and many examples given. A new problem complete for deterministic polynomial time is given, namely, finding the lexicographically first maximal clique in a graph. This paper is a revised version of S. A. Cook, (1983, in “Proceedings 1983 Intl. Found. Comut. Sci. Conf.,” Lecture Notes in Computer Science Vol. 158, pp. 78–93, Springer-Verlag, Berlin/New York).}

In this connection, we introduce a class NLT of functions computable in nearly linear time n(log n)O(1) on random access computers. NLT is very robust and does not depend on the particular choice of random access computers. Kolmogorov machines, Sch{\"o}nhage machines, random access Turing machines, etc., also compute exactly NLT functions in nearly linear time. It is not known whether usual multitape Turing machines are able to compute all NLT functions in nearly linear time. We do not believe they are and do not consider them necessarily appropriate for this relatively low complexity level. It turns out, however, that nondeterministic Turing machines accept exactly the languages in the nondeterministic version of NLT. We give also a machine-independent definition of NLT and a natural problem complete for NLT.",
