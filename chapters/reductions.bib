Furthermore, these sets remain NP-complete even under nonuniform NC0 reductions. More generally, we show two theorems that hold for any complexity class script C sign closed under (uniform) NC1-computable many-one reductions.

Isomorphism: The sets complete for script C sign under AC0 reductions are all isomorphic under isomorphisms computable and invertible by AC0 circuits of depth three. Our Gap Theorem does not hold for strongly uniform reductions; we show that there are Dlogtime-uniform AC0-complete sets for NC1 that are not Dlogtime-uniform NC0-complete.",

abstract = {Continuing a line of investigation that has studied the function classes #P, #SAC1, #L, and #NC1, we study the class of functions #AC0. One way to define #AC0 is as the class of functions computed by constant-depth polynomial-size arithmetic circuits of unbounded fan-in addition and multiplication gates. In contrast to the preceding function classes, for which we know to nontrivial lower bounds, lower bounds for #AC0 follow easily from established circuit lower bounds. One of our main results is a characterization of TC0 in terms of #AC0: A language A is in TC0 if and only if there is a #AC0 function f and a number k such that x∈A⇔f(x)=2|x|k. Using the naming conventions of Fenner et al. (1994, J. Comput. System Sci.48, 116–148) and Caussinus et al. (1998, J. Comput. System Sci.57, 200–212), this yieldsTC0=PAC0=C=AC0. Another restatement of this characterization is that TC0 can be simulated by constant-depth arithmetic circuits, with a single threshold gate. We hope that perhaps this characterization of TC0 in terms of AC0 circuits might provide a new avenue of attack for proving lower bounds. Our characterization differs markedly from earlier characterizations of TC0 in terms of arithmetic circuits over finite fields. Using our model of arithmetic circuits, computation over finite fields yields ACC0. We also prove a number of closure properties and normal forms for #AC0.}

abstract = {We argue that uniform circuit complexity introduced by Borodin is a reasonable model of parallel complexity. Three main results are presented. First, we show that alternating Turing machines are also a surprisingly good model of parallel complexity, by showing that simultaneous size/depth of uniform circuits is the same as space/time of alternating Turing machines, with depth and time within a constant factor and likewise log(size) and space. Second, we apply this to characterize NC, the class of polynomial size and polynomial-in-log depth circuits, in terms of tree-size bounded alternating TMs and other models. In particular, this enables us to show that context-free language recognition is in NC. Third, we investigate various definitions of uniform circuit complexity, showing that it is fairly insensitive to the choice of definition.}
