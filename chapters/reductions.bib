First, we show that alternating Turing machines are also a surprisingly good model of parallel complexity, by showing that simultaneous size/depth of uniform circuits is the same as space/time of alternating Turing machines, with depth and time within a constant factor and likewise log(size) and space. Second, we apply this to characterize NC, the class of polynomial size and polynomial-in-log depth circuits, in terms of tree-size bounded alternating TMs and other models. In particular, this enables us to show that context-free language recognition is in NC. Third, we investigate various definitions of uniform circuit complexity, showing that it is fairly insensitive to the choice of definition.}

In this connection, we introduce a class NLT of functions computable in nearly linear time n(log n)O(1) on random access computers. NLT is very robust and does not depend on the particular choice of random access computers. Kolmogorov machines, Sch{\"o}nhage machines, random access Turing machines, etc., also compute exactly NLT functions in nearly linear time. It is not known whether usual multitape Turing machines are able to compute all NLT functions in nearly linear time. We do not believe they are and do not consider them necessarily appropriate for this relatively low complexity level. It turns out, however, that nondeterministic Turing machines accept exactly the languages in the nondeterministic version of NLT. We give also a machine-independent definition of NLT and a natural problem complete for NLT.",

We show that TRAVELING SALESPERSON and KNAPSACK are complete for OptP, and that CLIQUE and COLORING are complete for a subclass of OptP. These results show a deeper level of structure in these problems than was previously known. We also show that OptP is closely related to FPSAT, the class of functions computable in polynomial time with an oracle for NP. This allows us to quantify exactly “how much” NP-completeness is in these problems. In particular, in this measure, we show that TRAVELING SALESPERSON is strictly harder than CLIQUE and that CLIQUE is strictly harder than BIN PACKING. A further result is that an OptP-completeness result implies NP-, Dp-, and Δ2P-completeness results, thus tying these four classes closely together.}

year = {2005},

address = {CAN},
abstract = {For every binary predicate  R , there is a  search problem Q R  for finding, given x , any  y  such that  R (  x ,  y ) holds.  Q R  is said to be  total  if every instance x  has a solution  y , that is, (\'{y}  x )(\'{y}  y )  R (  x ,  y ) holds. Total search problems are commonplace in computer science, and studying their complexity is therefore an important endeavour. In this dissertation, we present links between the complexity of solving  Q R  and the difficulty of proving the totality of  Q R  in the three logical formalisms: propositional calculus, quantified propositional calculus (QPC), and theories of bounded arithmetic. These links allow logical approaches to the complexity of search problems. We show several links between the complexity of a type-2 total search problem  Q R , where  R  is represented by a first-order existential sentence \'{y}, and the lengths of proofs of the propositional translations of \'{y} in bounded-depth Frege systems and the Nullstellensatz proof system. In particular, we prove the first direct links between reducibilities among type-2 search problems and lengths of propositional proofs. Based on this and the results on propositional proof complexity, we obtain a number of relative separations among the so-called NP-search classes such as Polynomial Local Search (PLS). Some of the relative separations we obtain are new. Let  H  be a QPC proof system and  j  \'{y} 1. We define the S q  j  -witnessing problem for  H  to be: given an  H -proof of a prenex S q  j  -formula  A , and a truth assignment to the free variables of  A , find a witness for the outermost existential quantifiers of  A . These witnessing problems provide a tangible link between the proof lengths in QPC and the complexity of search problems, and we consider them for various parameters. We also introduce and study the new QPC proof systems G *  0  and  G 0, and prove that the S q  1  -witnessing problem for each is complete for  NC  1 -search problems. Our proof involves proving the  TC  0 -versions of Gentzen's midsequent theorem and Herbrand's theorem. We introduce a second-order theory  VNC  1 of bounded arithmetic, and show that the S B  1  -definable functions of  VNC  1 are precisely the  NC  1 -functions. We describe simple translations of every  VNC  1 -proof into a family of polynomial-size G *  0  -proofs. From this and similar translation theorems for other bounded arithmetic theories, we obtain the hardness of the S q  j  -witnessing problem for  H  for various  H  and  j  \'{y} 1.},

title = {THE COMPLEXITY OF DECISION VERSUS SEARCH},
year = {1991},
publisher = {Massachusetts Institute of Technology},
address = {USA},
abstract = {A basic question about NP is whether or not search (the problem of finding a witness) reduces in polynomial time to decision (the problem of deciding whether there exists a witness). The fact that search does reduce to decision for SAT and other NP-complete problems (self-reducibility) is among the most well known facts in the theory of computation. But the general question of whether search reduces to decision for every language in NP remains open. We indicate that the answer is negative: under a natural complexity assumption (that deterministic and non-deterministic double exponential time are unequal) we construct a language in NP for which search does not reduce to decision. These ideas extend in a natural way to interactive proofs and program checking to yield negative results about the power of the prover and the complexity of checkers. We present languages in IP for which it is harder for the prover to prove membership to a verifier than it is to decide this membership. Similarly we present languages where checking is harder than computing membership. These results are also under assumptions about double-exponential time separations. Our arguments are simple and direct. We bypass Yao''s notion of coherence which was used to establish previous negative results in program checking, establishing stronger results by different techniques. By demonstrating-under the same assumptions-the existence of a language which is coherent but not checkable we indicate that coherence may not be the right approach to negative results in this area. The connections we establish with double-exponential time classes provide an interesting example of how complexity "high up" can shed light on properties of basic classes like NP and IP.}

abstract = {The class NC consists of problems solvable very fast (in time polynomial in log n) in parallel with a feasible (polynomial) number of processors. Many natural problems in NC are known; in this paper an attempt is made to identify important subclasses of NC and give interesting examples in each subclass. The notion of NC1-reducibility is introduced and used throughout (problem R is NC1-reducible to problem S if R can be solved with uniform log-depth circuits using oracles for S). Problems complete with respect to this reducibility are given for many of the subclasses of NC. A general technique, the “parallel greedy algorithm,” is identified and used to show that finding a minimum spanning forest of a graph is reducible to the graph accessibility problem and hence is in NC2 (solvable by uniform Boolean circuits of depth O(log2 n) and polynomial size). The class LOGCFL is given a new characterization in terms of circuit families. The class DET of problems reducible to integer determinants is defined and many examples given. A new problem complete for deterministic polynomial time is given, namely, finding the lexicographically first maximal clique in a graph. This paper is a revised version of S. A. Cook, (1983, in “Proceedings 1983 Intl. Found. Comut. Sci. Conf.,” Lecture Notes in Computer Science Vol. 158, pp. 78–93, Springer-Verlag, Berlin/New York).}

abstract = {This paper comprises a systematic comparison of several complexity classes of functions that are computed nondeterministically in polynomial time or with an oracle in NP. There are three components to this work:•A taxonomy is presented that demonstrates all known inclusion relations of these classes. For (nearly) each inclusion that is not shown to hold, evidence is presented to indicate that the inclusion is false. As an example, consider FewPF, the class of multivalued functions that are nondeterministically computable in polynomial time such that for each x there is a polyomial bound on the number of distinct output values of f(x). We show that FewPF ⊆c PFNPtt. However, we show PFNPtt ⊆ FewPF if and only if NP = co-NP, and thus PFNPtt ⊆ FewPF is likely to be false.•Whereas it is known that PNP(O(log n)) = PNPtt ⊆ PNP, we show that PFNP(O(log n)) = PFNPtt implies P = FewP and R = NP. Also, we show that PFNPtt = PFNP if and only if PNPtt = PNP.•We show that if every nondeterministic polynomial-time multivalued function has a single-valued nondeterministic refinement (equivalently, if every honest function that is computable in polynomial-time can be inverted by a single-valued nondeterministic function), then there exists a disjoint pair of NP-complete sets such that every separator is NP-hard. The latter is a previously studied open problem that is closely related to investigations on promise problems. This result motivates a study of reductions between partial multivalued functions.}

abstract = {We define several new complexity classes of search problems, “between” the classes FP and FNP. These new classes are contained, along with factoring, and the class PLS, in the class TFNP of search problems in FNP that always have a witness. A problem in each of these new classes is defined in terms of an implicitly given, exponentially large graph. The existence of the solution sought is established via a simple graph-theoretic argument with an inefficiently constructive proof; for example, PLS can be thought of as corresponding to the lemma “every dag has a sink.” The new classes, are based on lemmata such as “every graph has an even number of odd-degree nodes.” They contain several important problems for which no polynomial time algorithm is presently known, including the computational versions of Sperner's lemma, Brouwer's fixpoint theorem, Chévalley's theorem, and the Borsuk-Ulam theorem, the linear complementarity problem for P-matrices, finding a mixed equilibrium in a non-zero sum game, finding a second Hamilton circuit in a Hamiltonian cubic graph, a second Hamiltonian decomposition in a quartic graph, and others. Some of these problems are shown to be complete.}
