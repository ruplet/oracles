As an application, we show that there is a data structure solving dynamic st-connectivity for con stant width grid graphs with time bound O(log log n) per operation on a random access machine. The dynamic algorithm is derived from the parallel one in an indirect way using algebraic tools.",

abstract = {A projection of a Boolean function is a function obtained by substituting for each of its variables a variable, the negation of a variable, or a constant. Reducibilities among computational problems under this relation of projection are considered. It is shown that much of what is of everyday relevance in Turing-machine-based complexity theory can be replicated easily and naturally in this elementary framework. Finer distinctions about the computational relationships among natural problems can be made than in previous formulations and some negative results are proved.},

abstract = {In order to study circuit complexity classes within NC1 in a uniform setting, we need a uniformity condition which is more restrictive than those in common use. Two such conditions, stricter than NC1 uniformity, have appeared in recent research: Immerman's families of circuits defined by first-order formulas and a uniformity corresponding to Buss' deterministic log-time reductions. We show that these two notions are equivalent, leading to a natural notion of uniformity for low-level circuit complexity classes. We show that recent results on the structure of NC1 still hold true in this very uniform setting. Finally, we investigate a parallel notion of uniformity, still more restrictive, based on the regular languages. Here we give characterizations of subclasses of the regular languages based on their logical expressibility, extending recent work of Straubing, Thérien, and Thomas. A preliminary version of this work appeared in “Structure of Complexity Theory: Third Annual Conference” pp. 47–59, IEEE Comput. Soc., Washington, DC, 1988.}

abstract = {The class NC consists of problems solvable very fast (in time polynomial in log n) in parallel with a feasible (polynomial) number of processors. Many natural problems in NC are known; in this paper an attempt is made to identify important subclasses of NC and give interesting examples in each subclass. The notion of NC1-reducibility is introduced and used throughout (problem R is NC1-reducible to problem S if R can be solved with uniform log-depth circuits using oracles for S). Problems complete with respect to this reducibility are given for many of the subclasses of NC. A general technique, the “parallel greedy algorithm,” is identified and used to show that finding a minimum spanning forest of a graph is reducible to the graph accessibility problem and hence is in NC2 (solvable by uniform Boolean circuits of depth O(log2 n) and polynomial size). The class LOGCFL is given a new characterization in terms of circuit families. The class DET of problems reducible to integer determinants is defined and many examples given. A new problem complete for deterministic polynomial time is given, namely, finding the lexicographically first maximal clique in a graph. This paper is a revised version of S. A. Cook, (1983, in “Proceedings 1983 Intl. Found. Comut. Sci. Conf.,” Lecture Notes in Computer Science Vol. 158, pp. 78–93, Springer-Verlag, Berlin/New York).}

abstract = {It has been known since the mid-1980s (SIAM J. Comput. 15 (1986) 994; SIAM J. Comput. 21 (1992) 896) that integer division can be performed by poly-time uniform constant-depth circuits of Majority gates; equivalently, the division problem lies in P-uniform TC0. Recently, this was improved to L-uniform TC0 (RAIRO Theoret. Inform. Appl. 35 (2001) 259), but it remained unknown whether division can be performed by DLOGTIME-uniform TC0 circuits. The DLOGTIME uniformity condition is regarded by many as being the most natural notion of uniformity to apply to small circuit complexity classes such as TC0; DLOGTIME-uniform TC0 is also known as FOM, because it corresponds to first-order logic with Majority quantifiers, in the setting of finite model theory. Integer division has been the outstanding example of a natural problem known to be in a P-uniform circuit complexity class, but not known to be in its DLOGTIME-uniform version. We show that indeed division is in DLOGTIME-uniform TC0. First we show that division lies in the complexity class FOM+POW obtained by augmenting FOM with a predicate for powering modulo small primes. Then we show that the predicate POW itself lies in FOM. (In fact, it lies in FO, or DLOGTIME-uniform AC0.) The essential idea in the fast parallel computation of division and related problems is that of Chinese remainder representation (CRR)—storing a number in the form of its residues modulo many small primes. The fact that CRR operations can be carried out in log space has interesting implications for small space classes. We define two versions of s(n) space for s(n)=o(logn): dspace(s(n)) as the traditional version where the worktape begins blank, and DSPACE(s(n)) where the space bound is established by endmarkers before the computation starts. We present a new translational lemma characterizing the unary languages in the DSPACE classes. It is known (Theoret. Comput. Sci. 3 (1976) 213) that {0n : n is prime} ∉dspace(loglogn). We show that if this can be improved to {0n:n is prime} ∉DSPACE(loglogn), it follows that L≠NP.}

abstract = {We argue that uniform circuit complexity introduced by Borodin is a reasonable model of parallel complexity. Three main results are presented. First, we show that alternating Turing machines are also a surprisingly good model of parallel complexity, by showing that simultaneous size/depth of uniform circuits is the same as space/time of alternating Turing machines, with depth and time within a constant factor and likewise log(size) and space. Second, we apply this to characterize NC, the class of polynomial size and polynomial-in-log depth circuits, in terms of tree-size bounded alternating TMs and other models. In particular, this enables us to show that context-free language recognition is in NC. Third, we investigate various definitions of uniform circuit complexity, showing that it is fairly insensitive to the choice of definition.}
