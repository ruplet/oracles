abstract = {We investigate the expressive power of certain fragments of second-order logic on finite structures. The fragments are second-order Horn logic, second-order Krom logic as well as a symmetric and a deterministic version of the latter. It is shown that all these logics collapse to their existential fragments. In the presence of successor relation they provide characterizations of polynomial time, deterministic and nondeterministic logspace and of the complement of symmetric logspace. Without successor relation these logics still can express certain problems that are complete in the corresponding complexity classes, but on the other hand they are strictly weaker than previously known logics for these classes and fail to express some very simple properties.}

abstract = {We characterize the polynomial time computable queries as those expressible in relational calculus plus a least fixed point operator and a total ordering on the universe. We also show that even without the ordering one application of fixed point suffices to express any query expressible with several alternations of fixed point and negation. This proves that the fixed point query hierarchy suggested by Chandra and Harel collapses at the first fixed point level. It is also a general result showing that in finite model theory one application of fixed point suffices.}

Data complexity is the complexity of evaluating a query in the language as a function of the size of the database, and expression complexity is the complexity of evaluating a query in the language as a function of the size of the expression defining the query. We study the data and expression complexity of logical languages - relational calculus and its extensions by transitive closure, fixpoint and second order existential quantification - and algebraic languages - relational algebra and its extensions by bounded and unbounded looping. The pattern which will be shown is that the expression complexity of the investigated languages is one exponential higher then their data complexity, and for both types of complexity we show completeness in some complexity class.},

  abstract  = {In this paper we show that Ω(n) variables are needed for first-order logic with counting to identify graphs on n vertices. The k-variable language with counting is equivalent to the (k−1)-dimensional Weisfeiler-Lehman method. We thus settle a long-standing open problem. Previously it was an open question whether or not 4 variables suffice. Our lower bound remains true over a set of graphs of color class size 4. This contrasts sharply with the fact that 3 variables suffice to identify all graphs of color class size 3, and 2 variables suffice to identify almost all graphs. Our lower bound is optimal up to multiplication by a constant because n variables obviously suffice to identify graphs on n vertices.}

Next to classical results on plain logic programming (pure Horn clause programs), more recent results on various important extensions of logic programming are surveyed. These include logic programming with different forms of negation, disjunctive logic programming, logic programming with equality, and constraint logic programming.},

abstract = {Formulas of monadic second-order logic can be used to specify graph transductions, i.e., multi-valued functions from graphs to graphs. We obtain in this way classes of graph transductions, called monadic second-order definable graph transductions (or, more simply, definable transductions) that are closed under composition and preserve the two known classes of context-free sets of graphs, namely the class of hyperedge replacement (HR) and the class of vertex replacement (VR) sets. These two classes can be characterized in terms of definable transductions and recognizable sets of finite trees, independently of the rewriting mechanisms used to define the HR and VR grammars. When restricted to words, the definable transductions are strictly more powerful than the rational transductions such that the image of every finite word is finite; they do not preserve context-free languages. We also describe the sets of discrete (edgeless) labelled graphs that are the images of HR and VR sets under definable transductions: this gives a version of Parikh's theorem (i.e., the characterization of the commutative images of context-free languages) which extends the classical one and applies to HR and VR sets of graphs}
