abstract = {We investigate the expressive power of the typedλ-calculus when expressing computations over finite structures, i.e., databases. We show that the simply typedλ-calculus can express various database query languages such as the relational algebra, fixpoint logic, and the complex object algebra. In our embeddings, inputs and outputs areλ-terms encoding databases, and a program expressing a query is aλ-term which types when applied to an input and reduces to an output. Our embeddings have the additional property that PTIME computable queries are expressible by programs that, when applied to an input, reduce to an output in a PTIME sequence of reduction steps. Under our database input-output conventions, all elementary queries are expressible in the typedλ-calculus and the PTIME queries are expressible in the order-5 (order-4) fragment of the typedλ-calculus (with equality).}

title = {On the Expressive Power of Simply Typed and Let-Polymorphic Lambda Calculi},
year = {1996},
isbn = {0818674636},
publisher = {IEEE Computer Society},
address = {USA},
abstract = {We present a functional framework for descriptive computational complexity, in which the Regular, First-order, Ptime, Pspace, k-Exptime, k-Expspace (k >= 1), and Elementary sets have syntactic characterizations. In this framework, typed lambda terms represent inputs and outputs as well as programs. The lambda calculi describing the above computational complexity classes are simply or Let-polymorphically typed with functionalities of fixed order. They consist of: order 0 atomic constants, order 1 equality among these constants, variables, application, and abstraction. Increasing functionality order by one for these languages corresponds to increasing the computational complexity by one alternation. This exact correspondence is established using a semantic evaluation of languages for each fixed order, which is the primary technical contribution of this paper.},
