In a paper from 2019, Jean-Yves Moyen and Jakob Grue Simonsen discuss the problem of providing syntax for PTIME ,
concluding that in the light of their generalization of Rice's theorem [@10.1007/978-3-030-22996-2_19]. (problem w reprezentacji:
mozemy miec jezyk programowania dla P, ale odkladamy nierozstrzygalnos do problemu sprawdzenia czy mozna przetlumaczyc dana maszyne turinga na ten jezyk)

abstract="Classic results in computability theory concern extensional results: the behaviour of partial recursive functions rather than the programs computing them. We prove a generalisation of Rice's Theorem concerning equivalence classes of programs and show how it can be used to study intensional properties such as time and space complexity. While many results that follow from our general theorems can - and have - been proved by more involved, specialised methods, our results are sufficiently simple that little work is needed to apply them.",
