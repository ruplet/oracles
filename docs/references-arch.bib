Our first main theorem says that these hierarchies match, level by level, a complexity-theoretic alternating space-time hierarchy known from the literature. Our second main theorems says that a slightly different complexity-theoretic hierarchy (the Goerdt-Seidl hierarchy) also can be captured by hierarchies induced by fragments of the programming languages. Well known complexity classes like LOGSPACE, LINSPACE, P, PSPACE, etc., occur in the hierarchies.},

abstract = {A programming approach to computability and complexity theory yields more natural definitions and proofs of central results than the classical approach. Further, some new results can be obtained using this viewpoint. This paper contains new intrinsic characterizations of the well-known complexity classes PTIME and LOGSPACE, with no externally imposed resource bounds on time or space. LOGSPACE is proven identical with the decision problems solvable by read-only imperative programs on Lisp-like lists; and PTIME is proven identical with the problems solvable by recursive read-only programs.}

abstract="We show that a minimal dependent type theory based on $\Sigma$-types and equality is degenerated in presence of computational classical logic. By computational classical logic is meant a classical logic derived from a control operator equipped with reduction rules similar to the ones of Felleisen's {\$}{\{}{\backslash}mathcal C{\}}{\$}or Parigot's $\mu$ operators. As a consequence, formalisms such as Martin-L{\"o}f's type theory or the (Set-predicative variant of the) Calculus of Inductive Constructions are inconsistent in presence of computational classical logic. Besides, an analysis of the role of the $\eta$-rule for control operators through a set-theoretic model of computational classical logic is given.",
