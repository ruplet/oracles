in neergaard's logic for logspace, we cannot use the result of computation after doing an `if` on the result.
this 'affinity' seems to be the difference between algebra for FL and for FP.

but: we know a similar picture. in proof theory, we have dag-like and tree-like proof systems,
and the difference between them is than in dag-like proof systems we can name a fragment of proof
and then refer to the name in many places. and we have a lot of results about probably
exponential difference of size of proofs of propositional tautologies in these two
