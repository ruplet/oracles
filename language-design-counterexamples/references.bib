abstract="We show that a minimal dependent type theory based on $\Sigma$-types and equality is degenerated in presence of computational classical logic. By computational classical logic is meant a classical logic derived from a control operator equipped with reduction rules similar to the ones of Felleisen's {\$}{\{}{\backslash}mathcal C{\}}{\$}or Parigot's $\mu$ operators. As a consequence, formalisms such as Martin-L{\"o}f's type theory or the (Set-predicative variant of the) Calculus of Inductive Constructions are inconsistent in presence of computational classical logic. Besides, an analysis of the role of the $\eta$-rule for control operators through a set-theoretic model of computational classical logic is given.",
